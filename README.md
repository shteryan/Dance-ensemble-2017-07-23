Because we are living in a bacterial world and I'm a bacterial girl!
Armed and dangerous bitch!
Ya'll cant really hang with us in this
Everyone's so afraid of us/ shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit
Forget aboit all the things you heard before
'Bout time that we're kicking down your door
Everybody's gonna hit the fucking floor
Like " please Mike dont hurt me anymore"
I dont gotta have a secret lie or an alibi
everybody knows why I'm here
I'd just as soon crazk a bottle
As crack you over the head with a bottle a bear
So just listen up there powder puff
Better believe that I'm not playing
You can love it you can hate
But dont mistake it everboy's saying
